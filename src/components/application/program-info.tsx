          During the program, you will learn the basics of brainstorming and
          developing ideas, formulating hypotheses, collecting and analyzing
          data, and writing a research paper. This program is designed for
          motivated high school students to develop their research skills;
          however, anyone is welcome to apply. Although a completed research
          paper is not guaranteed as an outcome of the program it is likely that
          students will be able to write a 15-page paper.

          At the beginning of the program, students will have group workshops on
          research basics and methodologies, topic exploration and idea
          brainstorming, ethical guidelines and plagiarism, and topic selection
          and proposal writing. Parallel to the group workshops, students will
          start individual work with their mentors. The program will conclude
          with a symposium on research papers, in which students will present
          their work.
